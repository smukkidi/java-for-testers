Git Fixes: The Current Branch Has No Upstream Branch

It might happen that you are working on your regular day-to-day coding. You create a new branch, 
make some commits and then after doing git push you get this error:

Error: fatal: The current branch <branchname> has no upstream branch.
To push the current branch and set the remote as upstream, use 

git push --set-upstream origin <branchname>

Just do it:

git config --global push.default current

then

git push
